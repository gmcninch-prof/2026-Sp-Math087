    "and whose columns correspond\n",

    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposition:** For any directed graph, the matrix `A` just described is totally unimodular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to show every square submatrix has determinant `0`\n",
    "or `+/- 1`. Take any square submatrix `S` of `A` of size `k`. We will show by induction on `k` that `S` has determinant\n",
    "`0` or `+/- 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `S` is `1x1` the assertion is immediate from the description of `A`. So we now suppose `k>1` and that \n",
    "the result is known for square submatrix of `A` of size smaller than `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now notice: each column of `S` has at most one `+1` entry and at most one `-1` entry, since it is a submatrix of `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If some column of `S` is the zero, then `det S = 0` which completes the proof in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "If some column of `S` has only one non-zero entry, expand the determinant along this column. It gives\n",
    "`det S = +/- det S'` for some matrix `S'` of size `k-1`. \n",
    "And by the definition of row/column expansion, the matrix `S'` is again a submatrix of `A`, so the induction hypothesis applies to `S'`. Thus `S'` is unimodular and the proof is completed in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the remaining case each column of `S` has exactly one `+1` entry and exactly one `-1` entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It now follows that the *vector sum* of all the rows of `S` is equal to the zero vector. But this shows that the rows\n",
    "of `S` are linearly dependent, and it follows that `det S = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**: In fact, the proof only uses the fact that each column of A has exactly one `+1` and exactly `-1`. In particular it applies to any matrix with entries in `{-1, 0, 1}` with this column property — the incidence matrix of a directed graph is simply a natural example of such a matrix. (Notice: any matrix with this property is the incidence matrix of *some* directed graph. Why?)"
