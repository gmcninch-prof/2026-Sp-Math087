## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}

*You are expected to keep up with the posted material throughout the
course!!*

Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets* (homework),
two *quizzes*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). [Here is the
  planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math087--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).

- 2 *midterm reports* and 1 *final report*

  Note that you will submit a *proposal* for the final report prior to
  work. 

  Here are the dates:
  
  - midterm report 1 -- 
  - midterm report 2 -- 
  - final report proposal due -- 
  - final report due -- 

Please refer to the course website where you will find more detailed
description of expectations concerning these course
components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading
components by the following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component        | percentage |
|:-----------------------|:-----------|
| problem sets (average) | 40%        |
| midterm report 1       | 15%        |
| midterm report 2       | 15%        |
| final report           | 15%        |

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
