This week we'll discuss *integer programming*, which is to say linear programming problems where the solutions are required to be integral.

- Notebooks for week 6

- **Note:** If you are using `jupyter` running on your own computer
  (rather than via `colab`) you'll (probably) need to *install* pip.
  
  If you followed the [instructions here](/course-posts/resources--python-and-jupyter.html) then
  you'll need to run the command
  ```
  uv pip install pulp
  ```
  in the same directory that you installed `jupyter` and the other packages.
