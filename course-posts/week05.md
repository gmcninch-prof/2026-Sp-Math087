- Midterm Report 1 is now posted on gradescope. It is due Sunday Feb 15.

  - There are actually two assignments on gradescope for the midterm
    report. You should submit the text part of your response as a PDF.
    This PDF will include code listings and output. But you must also
    provide the code you used, submitted as a "text file" (i.e. a ".py" file)

  - Here is a model "toy example" for an easier version of the problem
    you are asked to study. It should serve as a good example of the
    level of detail and style of writing expected in the assignment.
